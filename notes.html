        <p><h6>What a WAV file looks like</h6></p>

          <p>Every press release and blog post about wavenet I've come across, have been accompanied by this very helpful gif:</p>
          <img src="figs/wavenet.gif", alt="GIF of wave form zoomed in and zoomed back out.">

          <p>It appears to be helpful in conveying, to people with some experience in machine learning but not with audio data, how impressively dense audio data actually is. In particular, it suggests that modeling audio in the time domain, shown here (as opposed to time-frequence domain), might just be really difficult.</p>

          <p>Earlier today, <a href="http://ethanhein.com/">Ethan Hein</a> shared, on Twitter, that he's also using this figure in his music technology classes.</p>

          <br>
          <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This gif is the single most valuable teaching resource I have for explaining how digital audio works. <a href="https://t.co/tLj6kr1wnl">https://t.co/tLj6kr1wnl</a></p>&mdash; Ethan Hein (@ethanhein) <a href="https://twitter.com/ethanhein/status/1281591318582632448?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 10, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

          <p>However, I thought it might be even more useful if it also reflected that, when audio is digitized, it's not just the time axis that discretized, but also the amplitude. So I made version of the figure that reflects that.</p>

          <p>Here's a few seconds of Max Richter:</p>
          <img src="figs/richter.gif", alt="GIF of wave form zoomed in to 1ms and zoomed back out to 1s.">
          <p>And here's Rick Astley:</p>
          <img src="figs/rick.gif", alt="GIF of wave form zoomed in to 1ms and zoomed back out to 1s.">

          <p>I'll post the code to reproduce these figures in the next update.</p>
